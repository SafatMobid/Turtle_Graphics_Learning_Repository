## Projects
### 1. **Basic Shapes** - turtle_Shapes.py
   - Purpose: Learn how to draw simple geometric shapes like squares, triangles, and circles using basic Turtle commands.
   - Concepts: Basic movement, loops, functions.
     
### 2. **Fractal Patterns** - To be added
   - Purpose: Explore recursive techniques to create fractals and other complex shapes.
   - Concepts: Recursion, self-similarity, advanced loop structures.
     
### 3. **Animated Designs** - To be added
   - Purpose: Create simple animations using Turtle’s motion and timing functions.
   - Concepts: Loops, delays, and animation principles.

### 4. **Spiral Designs** - To be added
   - Purpose: Create intricate spiral patterns using mathematical formulas.
   - Concepts: Angle manipulation, mathematical formulas, complex patterns.
     
### 5. **Interactive Turtle** - controlTestturtle.py
   - Purpose: Build interactive programs that allow the user to control the Turtle with keyboard inputs or mouse clicks.
   - Concepts: Event-driven programming, input handling, GUI interactions.
